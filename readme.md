## What is this?
- iptv-cutter

## What does it do?
- Cuts out channels from popular iptv sources to declutter them

## Why?
- A lot of services share common channels that show the same programming, so this removes them. It also removes categories/channels I'd never watch too.

## Can I contribute?
- Not to this repo, but feel free to fork it and edit to how you please. There's a GitHub action that builds the playlists.
